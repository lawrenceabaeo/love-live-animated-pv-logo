An example of one of those videos can be viewed here: [Click here for example video](https://vimeo.com/121440221)\r\n\r\n##What are its Features?\r\nWhen opening the webpage for this project, an animated logo executes in the style of the noted videos. \r\n\r\n##Why did I make this?\r\nI wanted to see how far I could get in copying the noted video’s opening logo animation using only CSS3 animations. I was able to get about 90% - I could not copy the particle effects that happen when the English letters turn to Japanese. In that case, I substituted an animation that uses the existing letters to get a ‘feel’ for what occurred in the original.\r\n\r\n##What technology skills were learned/retrieved?\r\nCSS3 animations\r\n\r\n##What are this project’s limitations?\r\n* The animation does NOT scale and is NOT mobile responsive. Use the browser’s zoom function to achieve additional zooming.\r\n* The project is NOT compatible with older browsers. \r\n* There is no high resolution background. \r\n* The fonts are approximate because I do not want to pay to use the exact commercial fonts. \r\n\r\n##Tech references\r\n* [Koruri font (for the japanese words)](http://koruri.lindwurm.biz/)\r\n* [Saxmono font(for the word ‘School idol project’)](http://www.fontex.org/download/saxmono.ttf)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
